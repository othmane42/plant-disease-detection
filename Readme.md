plant disease is one of the main problems in the agriculture that need to be tackled and may cost a lot <br>
in order to tackle this problem , AI can be a great tool to solve this problem with tests for early diagnosis using CNN .<br>

I used keras and took advantage of transfer learning for faster training (architecture used : <a href="https://keras.io/applications/#vgg16">VGG16</a>).<br>
